# Fullstack Nights Code of Conduct

## Short version

Our conference is dedicated to offering a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, ethnicity or religion. We do not tolerate abuses towards the participants of the conference in any form. Sexual language and/or sexualized images are not appropriate for any aspect of the conference, including talks, workshops, gatherings, Twitter or any other online medium associated to the event. Conference participants who violate these rules could be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without any reimbursement, at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## Long version

Examples of abuses are: offensive comments regarding gender, sexual orientation, ability, appearance, ethnicity or religion, sexual images in public spaces, intimidation, harassment, recording or photographing abuses, continued interruptions of the conference talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and sexual harassment.

We expect participants who are made aware of their abusive behavior to immediately comply and stop said behavior.

Conference sponsors are also subject to the policies against abuse. In particular, sponsors should not make use of sexual content. Conference personnel (volunteers included) should not make use of clothing/uniforms/disguises that are sexual in nature.

If a participant incurs in abusive behavior, the conference personnel reserves the right to take official action, which may include warnings as well as expulsion from the event without any reimbursement.

If you are suffering from abuse at the conference, know of anyone suffering from abuse, or feel uncomfortable in any other way, please contact any conference personnel immediately.

The conference personnel will gladly help participants in contacting the security personnel of the event location or the local authorities, provide escort out of the conference, or otherwise assist those who are the victims of abuse in any way so that they can feel comfortable during the event. We value your assistance.

We hope that participants follow these rules and regulations in the conference, workshops and any other social event related to the conference.
